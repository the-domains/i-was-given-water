"living water"

Lying in a dry bed

One night in the desert,

All things are together.

A scene of some house in texas

Arises above the throat

a dog barking

A screen door swinging

footsteps on a porch

And a growing rumble

of soon-arriving, ripping,

Tides of wet air   
and wind

Christmas as a child,

A miracle in Saudi Arabia.

Some man dies

for another.

A swoon

bones and heart

electric stations

Old things have become,

New things real.

To the parched and those Furthest from great relief -

In the desert,

moving.

something is moving

It is moving

Moving, moving, moving, moving
