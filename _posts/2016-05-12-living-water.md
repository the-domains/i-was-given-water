On a dry night bed

in crackling grasses,

All things are 

together.

A house in texas

Arises to the throat

_.....a dog barking_

_screen door swinging_

_fast footsteps_

_over the porch._

_A rumination_

_of soon-arriving, ripping,_

_Tides of wet air......._

_.......Christmas as a child,_

_Some miracle in Saudi Arabia._

_A madame tolls_

_for another._

_A screech,_

_High parts,_

_Spine bones and cardic_

_The air is_

_electric phrases!_

_Hold ON!_

To the dearly parched and to those it may concern:

In the desert,

behind the desert.

moving.

something is moving.

It is moving

Moving, moving, moving, moving, moving, moving
